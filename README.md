# 4760 Operating Systems - Project 1

Your README file should consist,
at a minimum, of a description of how I should compile and run your project, any outstanding problems that it still has, and
any problems you encountered

Your Makefile should use suffix-rules or pattern-rules and have an option to clean up object
files.
